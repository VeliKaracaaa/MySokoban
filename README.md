To do this, the player has the possibility of moving boxes (represented by ‘X’) by pushing them with his character (represented by a ‘P’) in order to fill all the rooms (represented by ‘O’). In the bonus section we can find the game implemented with color, menu and music bonuses.</p> <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="4" data-line-end="5">Usage: ./my_sokoban [map]</p>
